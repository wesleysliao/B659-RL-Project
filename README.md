# CSCI B659 - Reinforcement Learning Final Project
### Developers: Saber Sheybani, Wesley Liao
##### Spring 2020

## Notes for running the project:

The .py scripts support the Jupyter Notebook files which were mainly used for generating the report figures.

- TabularDyad: figure 2. Dyad of RL agents employing tabular SARSA to solve the Dyadic Slider game.
- DQNDyad: figure 3. Dyad of RL agents employing DQN to solve the Dyadic Slider game. Experiments include exploring the performance and the convergence of the multiagent system in various hyperparameter settings and task conditions.
